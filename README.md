Combahton JS Bypass

Nodejs application that determines whether a site protected by Combahton has the Layer 7 filter enabled or not. If it is, the application will attempt to bypass the validation. This method could be abused to create a DDoS script that is capable of reaching the backend server of a site hidden / protected by Combahtons reverse proxy. Details about how the bypass works can be obtained by taking a look at the code.

Please do not complain about the code since I made it in less than 10 minutes.

I do not take responsability for anything that is done using this code / parts of it.

To Combahton: Let me know if you need any help developing something that is harder to bypass. I will be more than happy to help :)
